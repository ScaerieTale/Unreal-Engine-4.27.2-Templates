# Unreal Engine 4.27.2 Game Templates

These files are copied directly from Unreal Engine Version 4.27.2's "FeaturePacks", "Samples", and "Templates" directories.

In addition, I've included the missing TemplateResources subfolder and files.

## Disclaimer and copyright

I provide NO WARRANTY or guarantee that these files will be fully compatible with later versions
of Unreal Engine. By using these files you agree that you will not hold me accountable if
anything goes pear shaped.

That said, nothing should go pear shaped. I've tested these personally with no problems on Unreal Engine 5.2.1.

These files are © Epic Games.

## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

Download as ZIP file, git clone, or whatever your preferred method of grabbing repositories is. Place the FeaturePacks, Samples, and Templates folders into your \*/Epic Games/UE 5.x folder. If it asks you to overwrite anything, you can safely skip those files, as it probably means I accidentally copied something that was present in UE5.

## What's inside

This repo restores the following templates, their associated FeaturePacks, and the MobileStarterContent pack:

- TP_2DSideScroller
- TP_2DSideScrollerBP
- TP_Flying

Note: Ue 5.x includes TP_VehicleAdvBP already.

Enjoy!
